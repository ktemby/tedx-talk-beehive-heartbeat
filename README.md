# tedx-talk-beehive-heartbeat

TODO's make that summary speech resonate.

Build up - 
1. We discovered heartbeat of the beehive
2. Beehive is an indicator for the environment
3. Bee Health is the heartbeat of the environment


What we discovered is something that can help Beekeepers save an individual bee colony 



If you’re monitoring a bee colony we can tell if it needs intervention before it gets to the point of a heart attack and you’re trying to save it’s life.



We need to pay more attention to the bees.  Yes we can save an individual beehive with the help of our tech, but when so many individual colonies are failing like this, it means that something is fundamentally wrong.



What I’m trying to drive home is the things that are harming the bees are harming things you may care more about - your dog, your cat and even your kids.  The things that are killing the bees harm them too.



So you really should pay attention to the bees in your area, because there’s something in that environment that is toxic.



These things are in trouble because there’s a bigger problem.  What does it mean to even save the bees?  It doesn’t mean that much for us to individually save those colonies.  Because if the rest of the environment is gone, has gone, and isn’t able to recover, bigger picture, we haven’t saved anything, we’ve just got another feedlot animal.



What’s true in the literature is that bees are an indicator species.  That means that when the bees are dying it means that all kinds of other things are in trouble.  We need to pay more attention to the bees





I want to make fun of that metaphor, because I don’t think it means as much anymore.  It’s just a metaphor now.  Whereas Pa being on the operating table, is very real
