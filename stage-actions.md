## Habits and getting practice

Get a routine for sleep, exercise, practice.

Make the things that matter, matter.  Make practice sacred time.  Make time for it.

## Going onto stage and performing on stage.

Develop a routine to do before your talk - meditate, work out etc.  You will be waiting for 12 minutes.

Start the talk with motion i.e. a step in the circle

Visualize how you want to feel when you walk off stage.  What emotion do you want to feel?


Starting the talk - start with 1 person to talk to - deliver a sentence to them.  Then find another - then move on and deliver a couple of sentences.  It feels intimate.

Practice planting your feet - and move with intention.

## Visualize
Story - when you're telling your story, re-live your story.

## Pausing
It's one of the best things you can do.  Let the ideas sink in.

Give people the opportunity to laugh if they're going to laugh.

## What do I do with my hands

Think about expressing your idea with one hand at a time.  

Avoid parallel gesture if you can (they're a bit distracting).

Clasping hands is a defensive subliminal cue.

Hands out open and up is another weird one - it indicates 'sorry'... hands down is a better move, comes across as 'i've got this'.

## Body language

People will believe 100% of your body.

You want to be conversational and connect.
